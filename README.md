SendBird Unity Sample UI
===========

### Creating a SendBird Application

The first thing you need to do is to sign up in **[SendBird Dashboard](https://dashboard.sendbird.com)** and create a SendBird application.
You should use one application per one service across various platforms.
Users in different applications can't talk to each other.

### Open the project from Unity 

You can open the sample project from Unity.

This project is tested on `Unity 5.3.0f4`.
